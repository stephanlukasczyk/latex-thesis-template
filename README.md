# Important Deprecation Notice

This project is no longer maintained and considered deprecated!

We provide a successor project with the [se2thesis](https://ctan.org/pkg/se2thesis) bundle;
you can find the GitHub repository for the `se2thesis` bundle at [se2p/se2thesis](https://github.com/se2p/se2thesis).
The `se2thesis` bundle is available from CTAN and part of the latest MikTeX and TeX Live updates.

LaTeX Thesis Template
=====================

A LaTeX template for a thesis based on ideas of André Miede's `classicthesis`
template.

This template removes a lot of options and packages compared to `classicthesis`
and is only usable with a recent TeX system, i.e., LuaTeX or XeTeX;  we strongly
recommend the usage of LuaTeX.

I've used the first version of this template for my Bachelor thesis, but found
that it is way to heavy and not flexible enough for my needs, thus I started a
complete rewrite of the template.  The old version can still be found in its own
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/stephanlukasczyk/LaTeX).
